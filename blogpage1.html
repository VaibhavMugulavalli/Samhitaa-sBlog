            <p>Contrary to popular belief, India was not discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1498; it has a rich history that predates European exploration by thousands of years. Long before Da Gama's arrival, India was known for its advanced civilization, including significant contributions in science, mathematics, and philosophy. Trade routes connected India to other cultures, making it a hub of commerce and exchange. The vibrant cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, the flourishing trade networks of the Spice Route, and the philosophical texts of ancient scholars all affirm that India was a recognized entity long before European colonization. Vasco da Gama’s voyage marked the beginning of a new chapter in India’s interaction with the West, but it certainly did not denote the beginning of India itself.</p>

            <p>Adding to this conversation, a British journalist recently downplayed ISRO's achievement of landing a satellite on the Moon’s so called 'dark' side, suggesting that NASA should be refunded for its contributions. Such comments overlook the significance of India’s advancements in space technology. It’s ironic that Britain, which continues to benefit from the historical plunder of India’s resources and treasures, can question India’s accomplishments. As Palki Sharma Upadhyay noted, perhaps it’s time for Britain to reflect on its own history and consider returning the wealth it appropriated, rather than casting doubt on India’s achievements.</p>
